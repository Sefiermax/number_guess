#below is a quote from the 2008 movie Taken  I thought it would be fun to replace some of the words and see what kind of wacky things will be turned out with it. 
madlibs = (f"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for a/an {noun1} I can tell you I don't have {noun1}, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.")
